This work is a Python implementation of the following paper:

M. Brown, R. Szeliski, and S. Winder, “Multi-Image Matching Using Multi-Scale Oriented Patches,” presented at the 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05), vol. 1, pp. 510–517.

Brendan Higgins's MATLAB implementation was referred to during the building of the program.
